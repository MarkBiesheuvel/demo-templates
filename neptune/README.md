# Neptune

This demo uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to build the Neptune demo environment for the [Planning and Designing Database on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/planning-and-designing-databases-on-aws/) course.

Connect to the EC2 instance via Session manager to run the commands, as shown in the outputs. (Need to switch to root user first `sudo su -`)
